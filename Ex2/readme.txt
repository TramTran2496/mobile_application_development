Exercise 2 - 01/03/2018
Tran Thi Ngoc Tram - 1414145

Some notes:
Result of exercise 2 is in file Ex2.php. I also write a file named Ex2.html to send request to Ex2.php. You can check by opening Ex2.html.
My work uses XAMPP as a server and puts Ex2.php at localhost.
So in Ex2.html, my request gets from http://localhost/Ex2.php with 4 parameters which are the coordinates.
You can change the link "http://localhost/Ex2.php" based on where you put Ex2.php and which port you set.
